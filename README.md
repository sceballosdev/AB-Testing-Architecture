# AB-Testing-Architecture
This is the architecture proposed at the presentation layer level, to work with AB testing or feature flags, in order to avoid many of the common errors in classes such as Activities, Fragments, ViewModels, UiMapper, Adapters, where usually a large number of if/else statements or duplicity of classes and code are used.
